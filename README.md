# Combat-Wombats-App

## To run the application:
First, clone or download a compressed folder of this project,
  then import into IntelliJ.
  Please use IntelliJ for ease-of-use when wanting to directly work with JUnit 5.
  
Second, you must build the application after it loads and syncs the project inside your IntelliJ IDE.

Please run this in a terminal: (you can also run this through IntelliJ's terminal)
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

The great thing about this project is that the JUnit testing suite is prioritised first before the application fully runs.
