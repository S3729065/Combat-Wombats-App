## To run the application:

  then import into IntelliJ.
  Please use IntelliJ for ease-of-use when wanting to directly work with JUnit 5.
  
Second, you must build the application after it loads and syncs the project inside your IntelliJ IDE.

Please run this in a terminal: (you can also run this through IntelliJ's terminal)
`./mvnw spring-boot:run`

To view the website, type: `localhost:8080` into your web browser's URL path input.

Inside the same terminal: `Ctrl+c` to Cancel the operation and select `Y` when prompted in the terminal with [Y/N]

The great thing about this project is that the JUnit testing suite is prioritised first before the application fully runs.
